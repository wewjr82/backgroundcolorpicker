<h2>How It's Made:</h2>


<p>Tech used: HTML5, CSS3 & Javascript</p>

<p>I created The Background Color Picker using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML code to create the basic structure of the picker, the CSS code to style the picker, and the JavaScript code to make the picker interactive. </p>

<h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>
<p>While creating this web app, you learned a lot about event listeners. I used event listeners to make the Background Color Picker interactive. For example, i used an event listener to change the background color of the document body when the user clicked the "Color" block. Below the block, the name of the color chosen is displayed. </p>
